"""
The code performs a simple linear regression analysis using the scikit-learn library. Here are the main points:

Data Preparation:

Input Features (X): A 2D array with shape (4, 2), representing four samples with two features each.
Target Values (y): A 2D array with shape (4, 1), representing the target or response variable for the four samples.
Linear Regression Model Training:

Model Creation: A linear regression object is created.
Model Fitting: The model is trained using the fit method on the provided input features (X) and target values (y).
Coefficients and Intercept: The coefficients and intercept of the trained linear model are retrieved.
Prediction:

Predicting Unseen Data: The trained model is used to predict the target values for a new set of input features (X_predict).
Output: The predicted target values are printed.
Results and Interpretation:

Coefficients: These represent the weights assigned to each feature in the linear regression equation. They indicate the impact of each feature on the predicted target value.
Intercept: This is a constant term that represents the predicted target value when all feature values are zero.
Predicted Values: These are the target values predicted by the model for the given unseen data.
Assumptions and Limitations:

Assumption of Linearity: Linear regression assumes that the relationship between the input features and the target variable is linear. If this assumption does not hold, the model's predictions may be inaccurate.
No Validation: The code does not include any validation or evaluation of the model, such as splitting the data into training and test sets or calculating error metrics. Therefore, it is difficult to assess how well the model might perform on entirely new data.
In summary, the code defines a linear regression pipeline that includes training a linear model on given data, extracting the model parameters, and using the model to predict values for new input data. The code illustrates the fundamental steps of performing linear regression but lacks validation and evaluation components.

"""
The provided results from the linear regression analysis can be interpreted as follows:

Coefficients: The coefficients are [-0.25, -0.25], indicating that both features have an equal but negative impact on the target variable. Specifically, for each one-unit increase in either of the features, the target variable would decrease by 0.25 units, assuming all other variables are held constant.

Intercept: The intercept is 5.25, representing the base value of the target variable when all the features are zero. It can be considered as the starting point of the linear equation.

Predicted Values: The predicted value for the input features [[5], [2]] is 3.5. This value is calculated using the linear equation derived from the coefficients and intercept:

Prediction=(−0.25×5)+(−0.25×2)+5.25=3.5

It represents the model's prediction for the response variable given these specific input feature values.

In summary, the coefficients and intercept define the specific linear relationship between the features and target variable in the training data, and they are used to make a prediction for a new observation. The negative coefficients suggest that increases in the corresponding features would lead to decreases in the predicted target value. The predicted value of 3.5 is the result of applying this learned relationship to the new input data.
