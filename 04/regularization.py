"""This script first transforms the input features X using the provided transformation function. It then computes the
necessary matrices and vectors for the least squares solution. Finally, it computes the optimal weights w_star and
prints the second weight w_star_2.

Please note that due to the nature of floating-point arithmetic, the exact result may vary slightly depending on the
environment. But it should be close to 1.5 or 3/2, which is the correct answer to the original question. """
